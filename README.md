## Description of the Project

This is a simple Java application called "Financial Tracker", this allows users to record and manage their transactions, as deposits and payments. Users can enter details like the date, time, description, vendor, and amount for each transaction. 
The application helps users keep track of their finances by storing transaction data in a file and providing reports for analysis.
That was designed for users who want to keep a basic record of their spending and income.
